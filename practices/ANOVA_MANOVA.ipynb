    "In the \"Bias Against Associates of the Obese\" case study, \n",
    "the researchers were interested in whether the weight of a companion of a job applicant \n",
    "would affect judgments of a male applicant's qualifications for a job. \n",
    "Two independent variables were investigated: \n",
    "(1) whether the companion was obese or of typical weight, \n",
    "(2) whether the companion was a girlfriend or just an acquaintance. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach could have been to conduct two separate studies, one with each independent variable. \n",
    "However, it is more efficient to conduct one study that includes both independent variables. \n",
    "Moreover, there is a much bigger advantage than efficiency for including two variables in the same study: \n",
    "it allows a test of the **interaction** between the variables. \n",
    "There is an interaction when the effect of one variable differs depending on the level of a second variable. \n",
    "For example, it is possible that the effect of having an obese companion would differ depending on the relationship to the companion. \n",
    "Perhaps there is more prejudice against a person with an obese companion if the companion is a girlfriend \n",
    "than if she is just an acquaintance. \n",
    "If so, there would be an interaction between the obesity factor and the relationship factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three effects of interest in this experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight:** Are applicants judged differently depending on the weight of their companion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship:** Are applicants judged differently depending on their relationship with their companion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight x Relationship Interaction:** Does the effect of weight differ depending on the relationship with the companion?\n",
    "\n",
